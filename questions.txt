Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis (Listeni/njuːˌmɒnoʊˌʌltrəˌmaɪkrəˈskɒpɪkˌsɪlɪkoʊvɒlˌkeɪnoʊˌkɒnaɪˈoʊsᵻs/[1][2]) is an English word that refers to a lung disease that is otherwise known as silicosis. It is the longest word in the English language published in a dictionary, the Oxford English Dictionary, which defines it as "an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust."[3]

3.  The usage expects a pointer. Also, making a copied value would take considerably more time and data.
4.  To initialize, it gets the first character of the file; moving the first cursor to the right as it does so If this first 
    character is an alphabet or an apostrophe, then it would copy this character into the index'th index of the array.
    The index is then increased and it moves onto the next character to copy, repeating until it is no longer alphanumeric (and
    therefore a complete word). It then puts the last index of the array as \0, to indicate that the word has terminated.
    It then adds 1 to the amount of words counted and thereafter calls upon the check() function, to determine if the word is
    misspelled or not. If it is misspelled, then it adds one to the misspelled count. It also resets the index counter for the word
    array. In the cases of a digit or too long of a word, the for loop consumes the remainder of the word and moves onto the next
    word. This ensure that the loop only works on words and nothing else.
5.  fscanf may allow for erroneous characters in the string.
6.  To ensure they do not change.
